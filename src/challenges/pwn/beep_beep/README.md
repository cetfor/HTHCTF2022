# Solution and Explaination

```
Python has many "magic functions" which are inherited by object types.
In this problem, if you type "True" or "False", the interpreter doesn't 
know what you mean, since these have been removed. However you can still 
access them using something like "2>1" or "1>2" etc.

If you look at the exception handler, we actually access "base exception"
via: ().__class__.__bases__[0].__subclasses__()[52].__subclasses__()[0]

By instantiating objects and 'walking' the magic functions associated with 
the objects, you can gain accesses to specific system functions. Ideally, 
the player will invoke "system('bash')" to get a shell and read the flag. 

However they could also gain access to open() and read() to print the 
contents of the flag too.

Origional Python 2.7 solution:
().__class__.__base__.__subclasses__()[59].__init__.func_globals["linecache"].__dict__["os"].system("bash")

An example of a good solution to get a shell is:
().__class__.__base__.__subclasses__()[104].load_module("os").system('/bin/bash')

Where 104 is the index of <class '_frozen_importlib.BuiltinImporter'> that
contains "load_module" which doesn't require a reference to 'self'.

To get the 104 offset, I used this command in a Python 3.10.6 interpreter:
for i in range(0,1000): print(i, ().__class__.__base__.__subclasses__()[i])
```
